What is VPC -

What is an IP Address -
IPv4 -  32 bits sequence of 0s and 1s. it consist 4 octet
IPv6 - 128 bits dotted hexadecimel 

Class A - Reserved for Governments 10.0.0.0
Class B - Medium Companies 128.0.0.0
Class C - Small Companies 192.0.0.0
Class D - Multi Casting 224.0.0.0
Class E - Research (Future Uses) 240.0.0.0

VPC
    2 Types - default/custom
            
Mandatory Components for VPC
    + Subnets
    + Route Tables
    + DHCP Options Subnets
    + Security Groups
    + Network Access Controll sets ()

    AWS Portal - Tenancy shows if a VPC is default for the Region and every account
        + Each availability zones will be having 1 subnets 
                    (az-1a, az-1b)
        + Route table - Main column shows if the Route table is default for the zone


What is CIDR(Range) - (Classless Inter Domain Routing) 
    easiest way to find the total hosts in a Network

    xx.xx.xx.xx/nn - 32 bits - nn - nn(2) (2 to the power 8)

    - xx.xx.xx.xx/32 - How many IPs - 32-32=0 2 to the power of 0 = 1
    - 0.0.0.0/0 - open to the world - or open to the internet


    IP classification in AWS and Available IP addresses for use
        10.0.0.0 - Netowrk
        10.0.0.1 - VPC
        10.0.0.2 - 
        10.0.0.3 - 
        10.0.0.255 - Broadcast 


NACLs (Network Access Controll List)
Default NACLs of every subnets allows all inbound and outbound
Custom NACLs will denies all inbound and outbound


NAT instances and Gateways 
    * Internet GW allows BiDirectional  
    * NAT Gw allows internet in a UNIDirectional way 
            (Request made from the Private Subnet will allow to reach to the internet but From Internet if someone tries to connect a resource in the Private Subnet WILL NOT Allowed)

        * NATGw will not take requests or Commands from Internet, ONLY from Private Subnet

  How Private subnet Instances will communicate with Public Subnet Instances / Internet - Bastion Host / Jump Server     



AWS LayOut

            VPC ---- | split in Private and Public subnets 

 Create VPC Network
    Must do - Enable DNS Hostnames (Actions - Enable DNS Hostnames)

    Create VPC - Enable DNS Hostnames - Create IGW - Attach IGW to VPC - Create Subnets 
    - Route Table - Add Public Route in the route table - Attach RT to Public subnet 
    Create 2nd RT for private subnet - Associate with Private Subnet -

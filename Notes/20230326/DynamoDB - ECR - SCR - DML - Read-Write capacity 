* AWS No SQL DB - DynamoDB
* Dynamo DB is serverless - No need of Managing loads of Computing capacity, Solid State of Storage

define 2 things 
    Read Capacity
    Write Capacity 


HA =  across Multi AZ 


Eventual Consistency Read & 
    Eventual snyc between AZ - (if main db updates and it will take 10-15 sec and it will reflect in other AZ - this is called ECR )
    * Latency is called STALE DATA 

DML - Data Manipulation Language - Create, Update, Insert and Delete (operations)


Strong Consistency Read 

Dynamo DB can increase Read&Write capacity without downtime. (Read-Write Capacity is kind of access or number of requests for Read and Write)

RDS has Horizontal scaling and DynamoDB has vertical scaling and Dynamo DB no need of any downtime for scaling
